# Preface
This is a fork of the original [Blades in the Dark Clocks Module](https://github.com/troygoode/fvtt-clocks) to handle Lancer-focused clocks. For compatability reasons, the ability to select a theme other than "Lancer Green" has been removed.

# Foundry VTT: Clocks

Create [Blades in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/)-esque [progress clocks](https://bladesinthedark.com/progress-clocks) within [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/). Supports both ad hoc Tile Clocks for use in a single scene and long-lasting Actor Clocks.
